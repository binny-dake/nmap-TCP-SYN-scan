3. Security Observations & Recommendations
üîê Database Exposure

Ports 3306 (MySQL) and 5432 (PostgreSQL) are publicly accessible. These should be protected by:

Strong authentication credentials

IP whitelisting or firewall rules

Disabling remote access if not necessary

üñ•Ô∏è Remote Desktop Service Detected

Port 5900 (VNC) is open. VNC is a known target for brute-force and exploit attacks:

Ensure it is protected with strong, unique credentials

Use SSH tunneling or VPN to restrict access

Consider disabling if not in active use

üåê Other Open Services

kerberos-sec (Port 88): Ensure proper domain-level security configurations

upnp (Port 5000): Universal Plug and Play can be insecure; restrict or disable if not required

afs3-fileserver (Port 7000): Validate necessity and apply access controls

ppp (Port 3000): This may be a custom or development service; review configuration and exposure

4. Conclusion
The scan reveals that the host at 192.168.1.16 is running multiple services that may pose a security risk if left unprotected. Immediate actions should include reviewing the necessity of each open port, applying access control mechanisms (firewalls, VPNs), and hardening each exposed service.
